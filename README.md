# React Redux Typescript Boilerplate

Skeleton for React & Redux Apps written in TypeScript (with integrated SASS, ESLint, Prettier, and Husky)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

### Purpose

Our main purpose with this Skeleton is to start frontend application with react with redux toolkit and typescript.

Try it!! I am happy to hear your feedback or any kind of new features.

### Common Features

- Quick start
- Integrated eslint, prettier and husky
- Integrated Redux Toolkit
- Integrated sass
- Based on Typescript Syntax
- Production Ready Skeleton
- Handle multiple environments [dev, stag, prod]
- Local Storage Utility
- Common Http Client using Axios
- Client-Side Encryption and Decryption
- Support to run production build on local machine

## Core NPM Module

- [x] `react`, `@types/react`
- [x] `react-dom`, `@types/react-dom`
- [x] `typescript`
- [x] `axios`
- [x] `react-redux`, `@types/react-redux`
- [x] `react-scripts`
- [x] `sass`
- [X] `serve` 

### Start the application

- Clone the Application git clone `https://github.com/santoshshinde2012/react-redux-typescript-boilerplate.git`
- Install the dependencies `npm install`
- Start the application `npm run start:dev`

### Handle Multiple Environments

- Make a new file in the root directory with the specifying the environment in file name. Example(`.env.{environment_name}`) -  `.env.development`
- Make sure, all Variables should start with the prefix REACT_APP_ . Example(`REACT_APP_{variable_name}`) -  `REACT_APP_APPLY_ENCRYPTION`


### Running the build

All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.
This is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.
If you open `package.json`, you will see a `scripts` section with all the different scripts you can call.
To call a script, simply run `npm run <script-name>` from the command line.
You'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.
Below is a list of all the scripts this template has available:


| Npm Script | Description  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks |
